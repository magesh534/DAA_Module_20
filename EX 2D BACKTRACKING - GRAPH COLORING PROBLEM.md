## EX 2D BACKTRACKING - GRAPH COLORING PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To solve the Graph Coloring Problem using backtracking, assigning colors to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color while minimizing the number of colors used.



## Algorithm
1. Create a graph using an adjacency matrix for V vertices.
2. Initialize a color array with 0 (unassigned) for all vertices.
3. Use backtracking to assign colors (1 to m) to each vertex.
4. Ensure no two adjacent vertices have the same color using is_safe().
5. Print the color assignment if successful; else, print "Solution does not exist".

        self.V = vertices
        self.graph = [[0] * vertices for _ in range(vertices)]

    def is_safe(self, v, color, c):
        for i in range(self.V):
            if self.graph[v][i] == 1 and color[i] == c:
                return False
        return True

    def graph_coloring_util(self, m, color, v):
        if v == self.V:
            return True

        for c in range(1, m + 1):
            if self.is_safe(v, color, c):
                color[v] = c 
                
                if self.graph_coloring_util(m, color, v + 1):
                    return True
                
                color[v] = 0

        return False

    def graphColouring(self, m):
       
        color = [0] * self.V 

        if not self.graph_coloring_util(m, color, 0):
            print("Solution does not exist")
            return None

        print("Solution exist and Following are the assigned colours:")
        print(" ".join(map(str, color)))

## Result:
The Graph Coloring program executed successfully, and the colors were assigned to the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
